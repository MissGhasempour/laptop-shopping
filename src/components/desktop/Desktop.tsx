        SoftTech aims to empower your business to unleash ecommerce growth by
        outsmarting risk. Ecommerce fraud teams play a crucial role in enabling
        their companyâ€™s growth and profitability. To do so, you require an
        enterprise-grade fraud and risk intelligence solution that can
        efficiently combat fraud, curb policy abuse, and boost revenue to the
        max. The problem is, the speed, scale, and sophistication of fraud and
        abuse can stretch the team and profit margins thin.
